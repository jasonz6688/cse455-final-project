# Welcome! 

This is my quickly thrown together site for CSE455. I really didn't have a whole of time to work on this, but I hope it gives you a little insight on my project. For a overview, please watch the video below!

**Summary**

**Graphs** \\
The Graphs I used in the presentation:

*First attempts at training the model*

![129SGD32.png](graphs/129SGD32.png) \\
*Turning down learning rate and model complexity in hopes of converging slower*

![1294SGD43.png](graphs/1294SGD43.png) \\
*Resulting unstable model after sampling the data every 2 seconds*

![1294SGD54.png](graphs/1294SGD54.png) \\
*Using the same sample rate, but tuning the model to reduce variance*
